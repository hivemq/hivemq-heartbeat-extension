== Prerequisites

* HiveMQ Enterprise Edition (EE) 4.2.0 or later
* HiveMQ Community Edition (CE) 2020.1 or later

== Purpose

This extension allows integration with load balancers and proxies.
It provides a readiness check via HTTP, which means a service is able to detect if a HiveMQ instance is offline and the load balancer is thus able to remove the HiveMQ node from the load balancing.

== Installation

* Download the extension from the {hivemq-extension-download}[HiveMQ Marketplace^].
* Copy the content of the zip file to the `extensions` folder of your HiveMQ nodes.
* Modify the `extension-config.xml` file for your needs.

== Configuration

The Heartbeat extension uses its own configuration file 'extension-config.xml' which must be placed in the extensions folder of HiveMQ.

| <port> | no | The port on which the heartbeat HTTP service should listen. Default is 9090
| <bindAddress> | yes | The bind address of the heartbeat HTTP service. Use 0.0.0.0 if you want to listen on all interfaces.
| <path> | no | The Path where the heartbeat HTTP service is located. Default ist /heartbeat
