== HiveMQ Heartbeat Extension

This extension allows integration with with load balancers and proxies.

=== How it works

This extension provides a readiness check via HTTP, which means a service is able to
detect if a HiveMQ instance is
offline and the load balancer is thus able to remove the HiveMQ node from the load balancing.

=== Installation
Unzip the file: `hivemq-heartbeat-extension-<version>-distribution.zip` to the directory: `<HIVEMQ_HOME>/extensions`
. A configuration file `extension-config.xml` can be found in the `hivemq-heartbeat-extension` folder.
The properties are preconfigured with standard settings and can be adapted to your needs (The meaning of the fields is explained below).
. Start HiveMQ.



=== Configuration

The Heartbeat extension uses its own configuration file 'extension-config.xml' which must be placed in the extensions folder of HiveMQ.
